        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frontend is the part of an application that simply brings it to life. It is the interface 
        through which the users interact with all of the functionalities being offered to them. It is 
        no secret that for me personally, the frontend is my favorite part of web development. There 
        are so many things to build in the frontend and so many to improve—so many tiny design decisions 
        that are instantly visible to the end users and so many user experience concepts that can be 
        implemented. Because of its high visibility, the frontend is also the part that needs the most 
        maintenance.<br><br>
